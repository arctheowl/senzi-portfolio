## Overview

The Architectural concept relates to wind and water, the generic forces that shaped Qatar’s landscapes. The same forces serve as creators of the MOT – Transport Education Centre in Doha. Land, Water and Air meet in the architecture of the building, as well as represent the main means of transport in the exhibition. 
Each element has 1 out of 5 dedicated volumes in the building. 
The Transport Education Centre holds areas for administration and staff, parking, VIP-reception, lounge and shop, meeting rooms, prayer room, and of course – the exhibitions.
A Large wooden sculpture in the main lobby defines the entrance and unifies the space vertically.
The “Water Transportaion” exhibition presents boats and vessels from different historic periods in a large pool of water.
The “Air Transportation” exhibition shows a series of small and midsize aircrafts.
