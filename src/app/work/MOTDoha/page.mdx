## Overview

This was my last project with the Atelier Brückner team. We submitted a pitch for the MOT – Transport Education Centre in Doha. The Architectural concept originates from wind and water, the generic forces that shaped Qatar’s landscapes. Land, Water and Air meet in the architecture of the building, as well as represent the main means of transport in the exhibition. 

The Transport Education Centre holds areas for administration and staff, parking, VIP-reception, lounge and shop, meeting rooms, prayer room, and of course – the exhibitions. Each element has 1 out of 5 dedicated volumes in the building.

A Large wooden sculpture in the main lobby defines the entrance and unifies the space vertically.

The “Water Transportaion” exhibition presents boats and vessels from different historic periods in a large pool of water.

The “Air Transportation” exhibition shows a series of small and midsize aircrafts.

While I enjoyed participating in the conceptualization and post-production of the museum’s exhibition halls, it was the architecture of the building that I found most unique and enjoyable to work on. Small but smartly planned details in the building make a big difference – such as rotational blinds on the façade, acting as an intelligent shading system, to keep the Qataris cool during the hot days; or the skylights, allowing for controlled, filtered daylight while containing adjustable LED lights and spotlights for the main exhibits.
