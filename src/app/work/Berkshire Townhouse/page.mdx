## Overview

This client came to our team, having already decided on one of the 4 Neptune kitchen ranges. The Limehouse range, with its parallel horizontal lines, is the only contemporary kitchen Neptune offer, which matched the architectural style the client was going for.

Despite approaching us for a Neptune kitchen, the client did want for me to specify some bespoke modifications. They were keen to have 2 full height ovens in a stack, as opposed to the standard aperture for 1 oven and 1 combi appliances. Additionally they were impressed with the quality of Bora hobs, whose technical specifications were not compatible with the standard Neptune cabinets. Starting with 2 bespoke units, a few more were upgraded in the process, allowing the clients to get the most functionality out of their solid wood cabinets. 

I separated all full-height cabinets into an alcove, coordinating for stud walls to be built around it by the appointed builder. This made for an architectural feature, turning the square cornicing into architraves. 

To keep costs down, the standard Neptune colour was chosen for this kitchen. Boldness was added with painting the back wall in Navy blue, choosing linear polished black metal hardware and contrasting copper pendant lights over the island. LED strips add an extra level of soft lighting, routered into the two floating shelves, and into the Silestone worktops. 

I was delighted to receive the following feedback from the client:
“Snezhi, we enjoyed working with you so much on our kitchen project and were so grateful for your knowledge and expertise. You made the process easy, listened to our requirements and when any problems appeared – you were always quick at attending to them. 
Having had the chance to use the space for a while now, we are so happy with how it all looks and works! Thank you!”
