## Overview

This client wanted a traditional-style Neptune cabinetry that she can use for her personal kitchen, doubling as a professional kitchen for her professional catering company.

Taking her budget into consideration, all cabinets, excluding the island, are presented in Neptune’s standard range colour, which would not incur an additional painting charge. The style of both cabinets and kitchen are fitting with the client’s AGA cooker.

The cabinets on each end of the AGA-run are rounded, to allow for a more open feel when entering from the two doors either side. The island worktop corners are also rounded, to protect the client’s growing toddler.

Due to a delay in building work, this project is yet to be installed.
