## Overview

This project shows a beautiful house in Berkshire that was being completely renovated by our client. As a returning client, they already highly valued our team’s expertise and relied on us not only for the design, supply and installation of their kitchen, but also advice for overall FF&E scheme, supply of flooring, accessories and lighting. Subsequently, we collaborated with the client on their living room, supplying bespoke sofas, engineered wooden flooring, carpets and a coffee table to match the style of their Neptune dining one.

The client wanted a clean warm look, with neutral colours and shaker style details with a bit of an edge. The traditional style of the cabinetry, and the chimney hood layout, suggest the presence of a range cooker. This has been juxtaposed with the modern look of gunmetal electric ovens, an induction hob, and dark metal hardware (from handles, to new flush socket plates).

I collaborated with the client’s builder at all key stages of the project, to ensure all First and Second fix requirements are put in place, all windows and doors are installed prior to the furniture delivery, to avoid swelling of the solid wood. 

Being invited to visit the space after the final snagging – I was delighted the feel of the space, and so was the client. The finished room is contemporary  and spacious, giving a calm and inviting background to the busy daily lifestyle of a full household. The open layout connects the kitchen and dining room with pocket doors, giving the host control over when guests are invited to join them in the kitchen.
