## Overview

Philips launched a series of digital and interactive stands during 2020 pandemic. “The Neighbourhood” was the biggest one of them, showing how versatile the Philips products are.

The brief consisted of Commercial buildings (General Store, Pharmacy, Gallery) and Residential ones,
showcasing Philips products making life better, for people from all ages and backgrounds.

Visitors explore the neighborhood through interactive elevations and dynamic pop-outs featuring persona and product details.

Our team was tasked with visualizing the Architecture and Interiors of “The Neighbourhood”.
I modelled each building individually to reflect the brief and persona description required, as well as form a cohesive, modern neighborhood.
The final renders were used as a 360 image, where visitors of the digital exhibition could feel immersed in the space and put themselves in the shoes of residents of “The Neighbourhood”
