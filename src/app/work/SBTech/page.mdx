## Overview

I worked with SBTech for 3 years, during which I built a relationship of understanding with the client. For their stand at ICE, London in 2020 I was asked to create a stand-evolution that communicates the company’s love for modern technology from first glance of the stand.
I was proud to have designed such a big project, worth over £1 million, as well as assisted with its project and site management.

A large, curved LED screen immerses and draws in visitors. Coordination for the screen was necessary with our contractors, for supplying supporting frames and rigging, as well as with video specialists for technical media details.
Colour-changing sequences LED lights are routered in the floor, coordinated with the main curved screen and the central Bar. The coordination between the floor lights and main screen make the stand dynamic and the atmosphere – programmable.

The floor lights also give the impression of a racetrack, which fits thematically with the client, specializing in sports betting. Demos are spaces across the “racetrack”.
Matt laminate floor with minimal sheen gives beautiful reflections from the main curved screen, while minimizing the floor maintenance needed given the large visitor footfall.

Bespoke demos, inspired by the company logo, required extra coordination with our workshop contractors, as they were designed to not be flat in any plane. The centrally positioned Bar, as well as the Reception unit were also bespoke and I provided detailed drawings for their production.

The client requested flexible seating for prospective clients, a Presentation area for scheduled talks, and 5 Meeting rooms. I planned the space so that the formal meeting spaces are at the back of the stand, while the rest of the floorplan offers flexible seating options depending on individual client needs. 
I collaborated with the Graphic Design department on all printed graphics, as well as frosted glass with cut-out logos for the Meeting rooms.
