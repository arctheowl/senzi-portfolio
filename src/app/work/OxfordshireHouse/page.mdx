## Overview

Client feedback following project completion: “I just wanted to say huge thank you, Snezhi, for all your work and patience on this project. It has been a pleasure working with you and you helped us create some truly beautiful and functional spaces. We love them and they are the heart of our home.”

Starting with a small Laundry room, this project grew into the biggest one for the company yet, worth over £350,000. I am proud for being the designer trusted with this bespoke project from brief to completion.

The client chose to collaborate with us for restructuring the general arrangement plan for their existing house and the planned 7.5 x 16m extension.  After 4 very different layout options and several alterations for each one – the client agreed on the hereby attached floorplans. Our team collaborated with their builders while planning the long term project in 2 phases.
Phase 1 included the fit-out of their Kitchen and Living room area. Phase 2 focused on their Utility room, Pantry, Downstairs WC, Dining room and Bar area.

All spaces were bespoke in terms of sizes, finishes and internal cabinet specifications. The client wanted to create a spectacular space and their budget, and cooking ambitions, allowed for high-end appliances such as Sub-Zero, Gaggenau, Bora and Quooker.

Phase 2 included the reconfiguration and renovation of the rooms in the original house footprint.

The client explained that my renders were one of the main reasons why they chose Ben Heath over another joinery company. While I find Autokitchen to be a limiting software, I am proud to have produced high-quality renders for the rendering engine’s abilities, and to have understood the client’s brief well.
