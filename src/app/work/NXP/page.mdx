## Overview

NXP Semiconductors were a long-term client of our team and the stand shown here (from Embedded World) was part of their annual Show Programme. I also participated in the design team for the stand evolution in 2019.

The booth (11x23m) was single level. Exhibitor’s guidelines restrict the stand design to have a maximum of 50% open sides. The client’s brief requested for a large Demo area, with a big screen for running corporate videos, 5 Meeting Rooms and Open Meeting areas. For functionality and hospitality, our team was also requested to fit in a Staff & Storage room, a Kitchen and a Bar.

The requirement for 50/50 openness ratio logically defines all the built-up rooms to be at the back end of half the stand, with Open Meeting areas at the front. All Demos, on the other hand, are positioned in the other half, making for a clear division for all visitors.

As part of the 3D team, we collaborated with the Graphic Design Department at Enigma for ensuring the stand is in keeping with the client’s branding. We produced Technical drawings for the stand’s floorplan and elevations, as well as Graphic elevations. This was the Graphics team would know the required from them work and liaise with our printing partners. 
We also produced individual drawings for each unique demo, cooperating with our building contractors for any questions, built materials etc.
