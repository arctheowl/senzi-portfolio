## Overview

The position of windows and skylights pre-defined the most logical layout for the cabinets in this kitchen. The client was also keen to retain their existing limestone flooring. Therefore, no services needed to be moved for this project. I focused on smaller changes that would have big impact for the look and functionality of the space.

Where the client previously had wall cabinets, I suggested countertop bi-fold ones, allowing them to hide a lot of the clutter and small appliances commonly stored on the work surface. The furniture layout was changed to include a lot more drawer cabinets, where the client can conveniently store pots, pans and crockery in the deeper drawers, and cutlery and utensils in the shallow ones.
The barstools, previously positioned all in line, are now wrapping around the island corner, granting the client her favourite view of the garden. 

Two colour palettes were considered – a calm, warm one and a bold, cooler one.
A glass splashback allows the main wall to be used for some of the client’s favourite art pieces. Last but not least, the bespoke furniture, made of solid oak, with dove-tailed drawer joints, magnetic catches on doors and soft closing heavy-duty drawer runners, give the clients the everyday satisfaction of high quality change in place, without grand layout changes.
