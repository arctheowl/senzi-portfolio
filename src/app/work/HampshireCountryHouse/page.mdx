## Overview

The owners of this contemporary house were partial to greys and taupe, and asked for our help in
carrying them through the style of the house, while retaining a level of warmth.

An existing client approached us for a design and supply of his bathroom.
The default company software (Autokitchen) was inadequate for the high specification details that the client requested for his bespoke joinery elements. To deliver the necessary quality and level of detail, I used Vectorworks, based on my previous university experience.
High-end fittings were specified, such as Samuel Heath taps, Cielo vanity units and quartz tops.
I produced Floorplans, Elevations and ISO views of the bespoke cabinets, which allowed the workshop to focus on small details, such as the mitred details of drawers for handle-less design.
