## Overview

Our team collaborated with 3XN and Yoke for the pitch and presentation of this museum. Both the architecture and interior design aim to reflect the shape of natural shape of fortress Trelleborg, of historical importance from the Viking Age. 

The building was separated in half to provide a view to the fortress. The windows in the passage-way serve a double purpose and, at a set time period, show an immersive projection, enveloping the visitor in the stories of the past.
As shown on the floorplan, the exhibition is separated into 5 areas, to build upon the visitor’s knowledge and experience. The exhibited artefacts and media overlay visualize the life in the Viking Age. The landscape is included as part of the artefacts’ showcases and walking through it ensures immersive visitor’s experience.
