## Overview

This project was drawn and visualized less than 4 months after I started working for Enigma CS and learning to use 3dsMax. I was very happy with the final result of individual demos being as close to the finished product as possible.

With its impressive 20 000 sq.ft - this is the largest exhibition stand I have worked on. Qualcomm exhibited at CES for multiple years in a roll and chose our team to be their designers for their whole Show programme.

The back of the stand was dedicated to 30 Meeting rooms, while the front had over 15 bespoke demos, each one demonstrating a different way to use Qualcomm’s chips.
As the demos are all different, uniform totems were created next to each one, to unify the exhibits. Each totem follows the same graphic language within Qualcomm’s brand colours and gives necessary information.

Vertical voiles and carpet cuts defined the stand areas while keeping it open-plan and accentuating the size and prominence of both the stand and the company in their sector of work. 

As part of the team, I had to model a dedicated sections of the stand and work with my team mates on bringing all models together for the final visuals. Additionally, each team member was assigned several unique demos to design. Presented are the demos I was responsible for, along with visuals, technical drawings and the final made demo for each one. 
I collaborated with the 3D team for modelling and post-production of the stand, as well as with the Graphic Design team, for creating all graphics needed for the project, adhering to Qualcomm’s brand identity.
