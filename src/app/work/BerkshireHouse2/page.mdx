## Overview


My client for this project had recently bought a beautiful estate home, with surrounding gardens as far as your eyes can see. With the age of the property, however, came a lot of small rooms which did not match the lifestyle of the young and vibrant family.

Working with the client’s architect, we opened up some of the smaller rooms into larger open spaces. The dysfunctional chimney and all the walls between the old Kitchen, Dining room and Seating room were removed, leaving ceiling beams to support the first floor of the house. The entire ground floor was renovated and functional elements went through significant upgraded, such as the heating and water systems. Adhering to a timeline for the estate’s renovation, I worked with the client on finalizing a layout and choosing all FF&E needed, before the new services and flooring had to be put in place.

A conversation with the client revealed that as a family they would spend more time in their seating area and would mainly use the dining table for bigger family events. They also wanted to be able to spend time together preparing breakfast and dinner, while the children might choose to read on the sofa or watch TV. Listening to their needs and habits, I suggested that a better layout for them might be swapping the previously positioned seating and dining areas. 

The newly positioned lounge-style seating is also best suited for the home owners to enjoy the beautiful view from their wide patio doors and windows. The Dining room, on the other hand, leaves two symmetrical walls framing the table, an excellent opportunity for sideboards or dressers to give all the dining storage needed. Warm green colours, natural wood and antique brass hardware were chosen for the Neptune cabinetry, to give a continuous feel between the interior space and the outside greenery surrounding the property.
