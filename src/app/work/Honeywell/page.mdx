## Overview

This was the first pitch I designed and managed on my own, from concept ideation to final visualisation and presentation. 

Resideo/Honeywell pride themselves with redefining the connected smart home with many varied technology solutions. They requested a design for their Show Programme, to be used at different size stands throughout the year.

I used the company’s agenda and slogan “Here for home” as an inspiration, shaping the outlines of the stands’ architecture. Just like Honeywell’s solutions can be used in any home, from small to large, the design proposal presents 3 different sizes of stand, with the unifying and easily identifiable shape of a house.

The 4 business sectors that Honeywell specializes in (Security, Water, Energy and Air), and their applications around the house, turn into the corners of the “house”-stand. As visible from the floorplans, all home services are connected via floor graphics/carpet cuts, leading the visitor to further exploration.

The stands also hold a Bar, which provides the hospitality aspect, much needed in any home and on any business-to-business stand. A tall LED screen in the centre of the Bar showcases all areas of application, while the individual “corners” use projection-methods only, to stand out from the competition.
