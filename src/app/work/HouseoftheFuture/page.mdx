## Overview

Our team collaborated with Richter Musikowski on the architecture of the “House of the Future” museum in Germany. This project focused on a series of exhibitions and interactive installations presenting the status quo, relevant megatrends and future challenges.

The futuristic facade of the building contributes as an inspiration to the content of the museum. 
The main exhibition elements needed to be flexible and partly mobile to allow for the ever-evolving future changes in the world.
The complex content was translated scenographically through the topics of nutrition, cities, health, business, energy systems and climates.

The interactive central structure continues throughout the whole height of the building and is “fed“ by information from the visitors.
Our team considered and presented the expected people flow and time spent in each area, as shown in the isometric plans.
