## Overview

Petrofac was one of the clients whose Show Programme I was responsible for, to ensure consistency and so that Enigma CS’s team members can develop long-term relationships with the client.

There has been an increasing demand for more reusable solutions at B2B exhibitions. Following that trend Petrofac’s brief put a high emphasis on the importance of longevity and re-usability of the main stand components.

When pitching for Petrofac’s Show Programme, our team developed solutions for several sizes of stands, and tried to incorporate as many repeating stand elements as possible, with sustainability in mind. Following the first successful show, we kept track of all available demo units, reception desks, bars, logos in various sizes, voil towers etc. All future stands were developed using the list of available items, taking the client’s initiative on adding new demo units. 

Petrofac’s stand at ADIPEC, 2019 included 2 meeting rooms with relaxed seating, as well as flexible Networking area with open bar-style seating. Several interactive totems were developed, which, along with the Presentation area, showcased the client’s business solutions. Finally, a Coffee/Bar area backs onto the kitchen, ensuring the necessary hospitality needs are met.

The voile towers were designed bespoke, to relate to Petrofac’s brand identity, and to attract visitors while maintaining an open feel to the stand. All reception desks, bar units, demos etc. were also a bespoke design and specification, to match the client’s requirements.

As this show was in Abu Dhabi, I could not attend its installation in person, however, Petrofac also exhibited at GOW, in London, where I conducted site visits and ensured the built was successful. Apart from the satisfaction of ensuring my design was brought to fruition, I enjoyed building the relationship with the client and getting feedback first hand.
