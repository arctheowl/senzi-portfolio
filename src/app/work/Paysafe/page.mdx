## Overview

The client’s brief requested a noticeable hanging banner, to enhance their presence at the show and attract visitors from afar.
Instead of a standard a banner or LED screen, our team took inspiration from the company’s logo and brand videos (with dynamic bubbles) and created a cylindrical perforated metal structure, subtly glowing in the company’s brand colours.

Paysafe asked for an open plan, welcoming and intuitive layout. The proposed design allowed them to showcase their services at open meeting tables and sales areas in front of high-level screens, while maintaining low-level and openness throughout the rest of the stand.
The VIP meeting area is intuitively separated by elevating it to the First floor.
