## Overview

Warner Bros partnered with Enigma CS for several stands, such as E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) and Gamescomm. This projects presents our design for their 13,000 sq.ft. stand at E3 in 2019.

Warner Bros’ brief asked for half of the stand to focus on an immersive design, since they did not have any hands-on demos, using innovative prints and multi-media, but avoiding “the standard” signage, banners etc.
The proposed design leaves the booth completely open from the front. Organized queues lead visitors into the 3 central theatres, advertising Warner Bros’ latest games. Large graphic backdrops in the waiting areas keep fans excited for the awaiting immersive experience. 

The rear half of the stand is entirely dedicated to Warner Bros’ business centre. A VIP entrance and reception on the side of the stand leads into the Holding area for meeting room appointments. From there businessmen are taken into 11 Meeting rooms (a mixture of sizes and some in an executive style), casual Networking tables or the dedicated Lounge area for Catering. Necessary logistics spaces are also provided at the very back, such as Store and Locker rooms, Staff room and Kitchen.
The rear half presents a much calmer and business-appropriate appearance, with logos and selectively placed graphics in the Lounge areas, and on one wall in each Meeting Room.
