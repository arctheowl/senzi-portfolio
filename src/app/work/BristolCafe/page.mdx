## Overview

This disused Ministry of Justice building will undergo both external and internal transformation, in order to become a non-for-profit charity Café in Bristol. The purpose of the new space would be to create opportunities for prison leavers by providing employment and rehabilitation back into society, giving them a second chance in life.

Our team re-planned the layout and current workings of the building, to detach it from other users and make it operationally self-sufficient. A new entrance door is to be added, overseeing the main street, to attract the attention of passerby and increase customer flow for the café. A new picture window was also proposed and approved, to allow more light into the space, as well as attract pedestrians from side streets. The majority of the internal walls are planned to be taken down, to create an open and inviting atmosphere. 

Opening up the space to a street entrance came with challenges for level access to the cafe. While planning the interior layout, we took into consideration all relevant DDA regulations. The new space offers an accessible stairlift platform and stairs into the building, as well as an accessible bathroom and baby changing facilities.

The hospitality area was design in collaboration with external PMs and professional chefs aiding the charity. The final plan includes a café serving counter, and washing station, facilities for light food preparation and the appropriate extraction facilities. Storage has been carefully planned and separated between back of house shelving for everyday use, and concealed storage under the banquette seats, for long-term storage.  

To keep the design on budget and aid the charity funds, the space is designed with open ceiling services, which naturally lend themselves to an industrial look and feel. The red bricks on the exterior of the building inspired the proposed images for all interior finishes. As upcycled or donated furniture can be used by the charity, the final result is a rustic and industrial feel. The café also plans to act as a retailer of art, upcycled goods produced in prison or handmade products by crafts people, so multiple flexible solutions were considered for display of all items for sale. To bring warmth, comfort and cosiness to the café, we have added warm lighting, artwork (both for sale, and giving information on the charity), as well as a true-to-size tree amongst the tables.
