## Overview

The brief for this tender required for a full refurbishment of the existing building to be considered, to better reflect the company growth and the broader remit of use. Formerly used as a visitor centre for school children who visited the nearby power station, as well as an offsite training facility, the current layout does not appropriately serve the new tenants.

The new design needed to fulfil a number of functional roles for the company:
-	desks space for a growing team
-	collaborative and communal areas
-	formal and informal meeting areas with acoustic privacy
-	break-out area and cold catering requirements
-	areas to showcase the history of the building, potential future projects, immersive experiences


As well as provide a great flexibility in the below requirements:
-	hybrid working and hot-desking
-	event spaces for lectures and school visits
-	confidential areas for day visits from external organisations
-	handle increased visitor footfall from interest groups and its effects on working staff

Our team also noticed to following areas for improvement:
-	a distinct lack of light in the building’s corridors
-	divisive layout of the office area
-	no dedicated reception area
-	missed opportunity to highlight exposed services as part of the learning outcomes for visitors

The proposed concept tackles all of the above points, offering the client a range of flexible solutions and significantly improving the functionality and social character of the office. A large office area has been opened up in the middle of the plan. Acting as the main office area, it hosts 14 set desk positions, as well as informal meeting booths. The adjacent room offers hot-desking facilities, and can be booked for confidential external partner meetings. What’s more, small 1-to-1 meeting spaces have been “carved-out” from the large board room, allowing for private meetings or potential hybrid working space for 4 staff members.

The building entrance has been upgraded with an interactive exhibition and a physical model of the building. Display cases serve as “Remembrance to the past” area, while on the opposite side, touch screens show a presentation that invites the visitors to get involved with future plans. 

The previously empty corridor, visually uninviting and echoey, has now been injected with a dose of colour from acoustic ceiling buffers and lights. Windows have been added to the existing ply walls, to bring light to the corridor and create a more open environment for both staff and visitors.
