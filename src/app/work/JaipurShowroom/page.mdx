## Overview

One of India’s leading handmade rug manufacturers, Jaipur Rugs, is known for having impressive, showstopping showrooms, that make lasting impressions. Opening their first UK showroom, they chose the Chelsea Design Centre, which raised the bar of their expectations further. 

When looking to make a lasting impression, I often believe the best way forward is to take a simple idea, deeply connected to the space/client/brand, and turn it into a great impact. In Jaipur Rug’s case, this was the colonial arches that “The Pink City” of Jaipur is known for. Starting from the very entrance, we designed an ornate corridor of arches, which makes a statement by reflecting the beauty, colour and graphical elements of The City Palace of Jaipur. 

The passion for craft is taken into individual elements of the retail design – using Jaipur Rug’s fabrics for multiple purposes throughout the showroom - wrapping the reception desk, hanging behind reception as a wallpaper, or used to fill in door pockets, making a special feature even out of the cupboard holding all services. The final result is truly unique, reflecting the client’s individuality and the artisanal quality of all products from the brand.
