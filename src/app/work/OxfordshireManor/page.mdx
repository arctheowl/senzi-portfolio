## Overview

The client on this project wanted a very quick turnaround and a full turnkey solution. I had 2 months to take the project from brief, to design, production of bespoke cabinets and to completion. I managed the timelines and costs for the project, sourcing external trades, such as an electrician, plasterer, decorator and plumber. I coordinated with the fitting team for all building materials needed for the stud walls, while scheduling regular meetings with the client to finalize the design, specify all FF&E and order all necessary items.

The property from this project was full of period features, from one’s very first steps on the Victorian-style encaustic floor tiles. The extension, at the back of the house, however, was in complete contrast – contemporary full-height glazing, continued through a sloped glazed ceiling to the second floor.

The client wanted to renovate their Kitchen and Snug, to match the contemporary extension style. The main layout worked well for them and as they wanted to retain the existing flooring – all services had to stay in place. 

A dresser used to be positioned behind the barstools, falling in the way from the main door to the extension. Removing the dresser, to provide clear walkway, meant that I had to think outside the box, to retain the level of storage. I proposed short wall cabinets, imitating a cooker hood, above the client’s Everhot cooker, to compensate for the removed dresser. 

A challenge that sometimes comes with properties of this period is the very high ceilings in place. The furniture had to be built proportionately to the height of the room, yet the client did not want unreachable tall furniture gathering dust. They liked my suggested solution of building a stud wall and fitting the Fridge run into an alcove. The design was subsequently developed to fit all furniture in the cooker run into a mirroring alcove. Photos of the building work in process are displayed, as I conducted multiple site visits to keep track of the project. 

Just as the property is a mix of period and modern features, the bespoke joinery was designed with traditional in-frame construction, mixed with contemporary slab doors and handle-less island.
As a company rule, most visuals would be rendered in neutral colours, so that the client can concentrate on the layout first. At the FF&E specification stage I drew inspiration from the existing flooring and splashback tiles, the warm tones of wood and cognac leather in the client’s snug, as well as the blues in the snug’s wall and in the uncommon frames of the extension’s glazing.
The result is a contemporary space with clean lines and bold contrasting colours, complemented by dark warm wooden tones.
