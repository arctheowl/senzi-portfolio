## Overview

Our team collaborated with Renzo Piano Building Workshop on this pitch for a 5000 sqm new museum located in Beirut. The museum is a hub of science, archaeology, history and civilization.

The BCM pitch presents a strategic approach to preserve, educate about and better present the Beirut History and Archaeological Heritage. The main 3 thematic clusters shown are people, history and evidence.

The museum’s location is in direct proximity to archaeological findings and excavation site, which is why it was designer to be a “vertical museum” that embodies the rich layers and stratification of the archaeological site surroundings. The Atelier Brückner team used this opportunity to tell Beirut’s story through the contents of the exhibition (via glass displays and interactive showcases), as well as through highlighting the archaeological park nearby. The latter is to be achieved by a room at high level with dual function – while primarily a cinema room, at a fixed interval of time, the LED screens would rotate, imitating open blinds and allowing the visitors a first-hand view of the nearby excavation site.
