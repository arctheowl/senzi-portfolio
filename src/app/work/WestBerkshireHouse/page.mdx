## Overview

The owners of this contemporary house were partial to greys and taupe, and asked for our help in
carrying them through the style of the house, while retaining a level of warmth.

For the 7 rooms we designed, we aimed to maintain the clean, minimal architectural style and bring
out the clients’ personalities with textures, patterns and the warmth of stained wood.

For Phase 1 we focused on their Kitchen, Utility and Living room.
The minimal and linear architecture of the house was continued in the kitchen through a drop-down ceiling and a lighting feature running parallel to the island. We aimed and achieved symmetry from all viewpoints.

The Living room boasts muted yet contrasting tones. Luxurious fabrics, statement lighting and bespoke fitted and freestanding furniture give this space it's calm and warm atmosphere. From the entertainment cabinet, to the sofas, cushions and curtains - the room is full of bespoke details and personality.

For Phase 2 I designed and managed the project of renovating their 3 + 1/2 bathrooms, for a total budget of £80,000.

From cosmetic changes of all finishes in the downstairs toilet, to full layout re-organization of the
Master En-suite - this was an intensive introduction to bathroom design.
The En-suite used to have a fitted bathtub and a corner shower cubicle. Now it is completely
Transformed – with a wow-factor shower, marble-styled wall tiles and LED-lit open wall cabinets. A freestanding bath with background panelling gives the luxurious feeling the client desired. 
All bathrooms are complimented by fitted storage, concealed WC cisterns, minimal-style hardware and large mirrors, giving a spacious feel. The cabinetry style is continued throughout.

Project managing the job involved planning of all renovation stages, from rip-out of
the previous interiors, to retiling and carpeting, electrical and plaster work, decoration,
major plumbing relocation in bathrooms, to new fittings’ installation and snagging.
