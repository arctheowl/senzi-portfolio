## Overview

The client on this project wanted an open-plan Kitchen-Dining-Living space where the Kitchen island is a focal point to impress all their guests.

As the client loved the look of marble, but wanted a very durable worktop solution, a book-matched mitred waterfall on both island ends was initially suggested. While this would have created the desired wow-factor, follow-up consultations uncovered budget limitations. An Ogee profile with curved ends was the alternative chosen solution.

I focused on creating a symmetrical space that follows the client’s brief for impressive look and detailed functionality, with many bespoke internal cabinet specifications. The symmetrical result in the visuals is a major factor for achieving the desired aesthetics, along with the rippled-effect glazed and internally lit island cabinets, bronze hardware and furniture using soft natural colours.
Pockets of individuality can be added to the Kitchen area, with encaustic splashback tiles and a display shelf above.

The Living/Dining area provides the client with plenty comfortable seating and functional storage solutions. The open-shelf countertop cabinets provide opportunities for personalization.
The design of the room uses only low-level furniture in the center, to connect the chef of the house with the rest of the family and invite guests to socialize.

This space is being built during Q3 of 2023 and all furniture will be delivered and installed at Q4. Due to the end of my employment at Ben Heath Interiors, I was not able to see the project through to completion. I did, however, start the FF&E specification process for all appliances needed and issued a Service plan for First Fix, and to ensure the smooth transition between project stages.
