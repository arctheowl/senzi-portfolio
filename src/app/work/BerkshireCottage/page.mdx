## Overview

A long narrow room naturally lends itself to a galley kitchen and my clients were happy to keep this layout for their cottage kitchen. 

A radiator was positioned under the left window, so I presented them with two options – one where they keep the radiator where it is, and one where the radiator gets moved, updated to a tall slim one, and fixed onto the end of a full height cabinet. The client liked the latter idea, which is the design presented here. The client opted for an Armac Martin brass grille to cover the new radiator, ensuring ventilation and adding style to a functional element.

I coordinated external trades, such as a plumber, for moving the radiator pipes, as well as a plasterer, decorator and electrician, for re-doing the ceiling and changing all ceiling lights to energy-saving dimmable LED spotlights. 

The client was partial to clean, white cabinets and worktops, keeping a traditional cabinetry style to compliment the age of their cottage. The solid wood finish of the cabinets’ interior was coordinated with the natural oak honey tones of their flooring. Smart internal storage solutions make this kitchen not only bright and beautiful, but also extremely functional. Countertop appliances are hidden inside cabinets with pull-out drawers, while spices are neatly arranged in racks on wall cabinet doors.
