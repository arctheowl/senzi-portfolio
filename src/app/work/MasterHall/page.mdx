## Overview

This is the last project I worked on with Enigma CS, and I was the only Interior Designer assigned to the brief. I worked in a close collaboration with a Graphic designer to ensure continuity of the client’s brand.

The project involved pitching for the renovation, master planning and design of an exhibition hall.
The brief requested a combination of Open and Private Meeting facilities for start-up companies,
A Presentation stage for over 50 people, as well as flexible Catering and Hospitality areas.

The requested material theme was rustic/ natural wood and inspiration images were provided of re-purposed pallet furniture. The client’s logo represented the theme “Together”. Openness and people-flow was hence important to the design an overall final atmosphere.
The design uses oriented structural straw boards and repurposed pallets, for added rustic character. The client’s logo has been used to create Signage and Wayfinding opportunities, while staying on-brand and unifying the key spaces.

The proposed design offers fluid spaces for networking. Slatted walls are used to create semi - private spaces, as a budget option to glass. The start-up companies can enjoy high-exposure and several informal meeting options – dedicated demos, semi-private “quiet zones” or the use of the informal catering area.
Private meeting can be scheduled in the enclosed meeting rooms. A central booth is provided for every 4 start-ups.

A wheel-in food truck creates an informal catering area with varied Lounge-style or Barstool seating.
The Presentation stage is set at the back, but visible from afar, inviting all visitors to the open talks.
