## Overview

The client on this project, a security communications leader, wanted to update their facilities and provide their staff with an office and meeting areas reflecting the quality of the modern technology and services they themselves offered. 

This project required special attention to detail when developing a concept and spatial layout, due to a variety of needs for multiple teams, all sharing the same the Ground floor of the building. Multiple meetings were set-up between Intend and the client, to allow our team to understand in depth the individual needs, user workflow, and collaboration between the teams. Regular communication and concept revision meetings with the Facilities Manager, selected representatives of each team, as well as stakeholders, were essential for arriving to the perfect layout. Albeit a long process, this allowed me to get to know the client better, to form strong relationships and achieve an environment of shared trust and constructive criticism of all shared ideas.

While the project has been paused, awaiting the next financial year (2025), the design concept was brought forward significantly and is awaiting final approval. The final layout offers a mix of:
-	standard set-up desk spaces (along with the client specific engineer’s working benches)
-	cellular offices
-	technical secure areas
-	small meeting rooms, flexible meeting spaces, large board room
-	storage – both full-height and half-height with planters
-	technical facilities – printers, 3D printers, library 
-	functional breakout area with all modern facilities
-	various flexible breakout spaces – booths, high-stool touchpoints, bleacher seats

Through all design stages I worked with the client’s focus group to understand all technicalities that are specific to their industry and facilities (e.g. location of 3D printers due to noise, technical requirements for the secure rooms etc).

During the FF&E specification phase, we paid special attention to making the large office area work, by adding acoustic solutions and biophilic elements, as well as breaking down the space visually, with the use of patterned change of floor planks. For the office, we selected colours and fabrics that reflect the client’s brand, yet invoke productivity and alertness, present the corporate nature of meeting rooms and the modern look the client wanted to achieve. In the breakout areas, the blues naturally transition into greens, achieving a calmer environment and inviting staff to take a break, rest and reconnect with nature. The warmer tones, natural woods and wall panelling, reminiscent of residential interiors, is thoughtfully places to create a sense of comfort and inspire social connections.
